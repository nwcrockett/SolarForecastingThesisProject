# ES-RNN-Pytorch

# Overview
This is a work in progress Pytorch implementation of the recently proposed ES-RNN by Slawek Smyl, winner of the M4 competition.

## Progress: 

- [x] Implement Single Series Model based on Additive season and level in Pytorch 
- [x] Implement toy datset, and Pytorch data functions
- [x] Test and Debug SSM on Toy Dataset
- [ ] Implemente multiplicative season and trend
- [ ] Implement Multi Series Model with shared Trend LSTM
- [ ] Implement Multi Series Multi Output Model 
- [ ] Compare performance on benchmark dataset
